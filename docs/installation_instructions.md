### Installation Instructions

This is the Installation Instruction for the Horse Show Administration program developed by the Capstone Horse Show Administration Team. There are three main parts to this installation:

1) Set up the computer with the required dependencies
2) Clone the repo onto the computer
3) Download and launch the packaged app to start the server

These instructions assume you are using a Windows 10 OS. You can’t successfully test/implement these installation instructions without a Windows computer.

TravisCI status: [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/UVA-Capstone-Practicum-1819/Horse-Show-Administration.svg?token=zrpu68ydy2osA7tAdwBJ&branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/UVA-Capstone-Practicum-1819/Horse-Show-Administration)

The mission of the Hoof-N-Woof 4-H in accordance with the Virginia 4-H Horse Program is development of youth using the horse as the vehicle.  The emphasis is on building horsemanship skills, leadership, public speaking, community service, physical fitness and personal and emotional development.  The love of horses can lead to a life-long hobby or business.  The youth do not have to own or even have access to horses as there are an abundance of projects and activities for all youth who love the animal.

The horse industry is behind in show data processing because there is lack of access to the internet and the rural nature of the competitions. We don’t see a lot of computer programs for horse shows. This is kind of a unique product we are looking for. We need a product that allows us to enter horse information and exhibitor information. We should be able to create shows. Each show will have multiple division and each division can have multiple classes. Exhibitors choose which horse they will ride and pick the classes appropriate for that animal. For each class we would like to be able to enter the results (points) per exhibitor. Points in the same division gets added up to figure out who is the division champion and reserve champion after all the classes in this division are completed. At the end of the day, we would like to be able to determine the “high point” champion for horses and “high point” champion for ponies. We would like to be able to export these reports to submit them to the Virginia Horse Show Association and and the state 4-H horse program.
